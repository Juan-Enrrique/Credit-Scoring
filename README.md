# Credit Score Classification

This project focuses on classifying credit scores using a cleaned version of the Kaggle-provided **Credit Score Dataset for Classification**. The aim is to predict a userâ€™s credit score, which can help financial institutions assess risk and make informed lending decisions. A range of machine learning models were evaluated to identify the optimal solution, achieving a current accuracy of approximately **80.38%** with the Random Forest model.

## Dataset

- **Source**: Kaggle Credit Score Classification Dataset
- **Dataset Used**: `https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parisrohan/credit-score-classification`
- **Preprocessing**: Dataset was cleaned prior to analysis to streamline the modelling process.

## Results
- Current accuracy: 80.38%
- Optimisation inprogress to enhance accuracy through model tuning and experimentation with additional algorithms

## Future Work
- Exploring advanced machine learning and deep learning models to push accuracy closer to 90%
- Further feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance
